# correct-conversation
Website landing page for a private tutor to teach English to foreign or oversea students to help speak fluent English in a manner of having natural conversations in day-to-day life.

The landing page was designed and created with photoshop and then made in HTML. Page layout used a 2 grid CSS layout with text and illustrations on either side. The navigation bar used javascript and JQuery for smooth scrolling of sections of the page whilst also being visible on top for accessibility, also to contact the tutor I made a simple form so they could be contacted and used a PHP script to make that function.

Overall for the first project I learnt about converting a photoshop design into HTML and using a basic CSS grid system to layout content and overcoming harder tasks such as merging JQuery and PHP on the page to make it function.
